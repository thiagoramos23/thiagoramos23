## Who is me?

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thiago Ramos. I am a brazilian software developer who loves to build things but also loves to do other stuff.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and music, but here you will probably see my work with software development. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and learning Elixir and the whole ecosystem behind it. So far it's been the best days of my life.

ðŸ“« How to reach me? You can contact me by my personal email: thiagoramos.al@gmail.com
